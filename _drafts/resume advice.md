Some advice for early-career and mid-career folks who need some help to improve their resumes.

If you're a designer or something, you probably won't benefit from these notes.

I should hope that this sort of advice is something everyone hears at some point, but lots of people don't have access to the resources and mentoring that would offer resume guidance.

Another thing to note: there are people who read resumes who'll disagree with everything I say here. That's okay. I'm just sharing one approach that people may find helpful. 

Like every form of communication, there's no perfect formula. There's no perfect rubric. Everything varies depending on the writer and audience. But for anxious job-seekers, too much conflicting advice can just make things harder. That's why I try to be specific and opinionated with my advice here.

## the "good enough" resume

I went through a couple periods of my life when I *obsessed* about resume formatting and content. I read every article, lurked every advice forum. Nobody should have to do this.

Resumes are a tool, they're a means to an end. The resume alone won't get you your dream job, and to be honest it shouldn't carry that much weight in the scheme of things. **The purpose of your resume is to get you an interview.** The interview is to get you the job.

Why does this matter? It helps you scope you efforts.

Your resume is a form of communication, and one of the most important things about communicating is knowing your audience. If you have an idea about who is going to read your resume, you can speak to them specifically. That's a lot easier than trying to get the attention of everybody at once.

## sections

If I had to pick a required set of sections, I'd go with this:

- name and contact info
- summary
- experience
- education

Take this with huge grain of salt. It's *your* resume, it needs to tell your story. For example, some people don't have any post-high school education. If that describes you, then don't include an education section. You likely have plenty of experience to fill out the page with.

Sections to leave out:

- objective
- hobbies
- volunteer work (this goes under experience)
- coursework

## content

Let's go through what content to include in each section.

### name and contact info

This should be straightforward, right? Well...

The main thing is not to put your home address.

Another thing I like to include, especially when I was early in my career, is the job title I was applying for:

> Shelby Spees: Site Reliability Engineer

I have zero data to back this up, my gut tells me that it creates an association for the reader between your name and your desired role. But honestly, I mostly think it looks cool and it can't hurt. At the very least, it helps busy hiring managers see wtf position you applied for.

For the rest of your contact info:

- email
- phone
- url #1 - LinkedIn
- url #2 - GitHub (optional)

Sub out LinkedIn for your personal site, if you have a nice one.

Btw, not enough people [update LinkedIn to use a custom path](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/87/customizing-your-public-profile-url?lang=en). This is especially valuable if you have a more unique name. Mine looks like this: `linkedin.com/in/shelbyspees`

### summary

Old school resumes would include an objective that looked like this:

> Objective: to obtain a position where I can utilize my skills...

Don't write that. It's meaningless and a waste of space.

Remember what we're trying to communicate here: "Hey hiring manager, I check all the boxes. You should bring me in for an interview."
