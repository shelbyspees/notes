## digital garden

these are my personal notes, maintained in a [wiki]() format to create what's commonly referred to as a [digital garden]():

> (a digital garden is...)

after struggling with content creation and publishing for traditional blog posts, I decided to try out a new approach. this site is a wiki where I collect and groom my thoughts. it's public, but not polished. there may be broken or missing links, 

## commit history

all of my notes are kept under version control on [github](). publishing via obsidian is automatic but commits are a manual step, so there may be a time difference between when content is updated publicly and when that change gets committed and pushed to the remote repository. maintaining a history of changes is meant to be best-effort, so I am explicitly not guaranteeing that commits on the repo will reflect precise changelogs for published content.

## commitment to accessibility
web accessibility is a right, and I commit to following W3C recommended practices on this site and others I maintain. still, I am not a professional frontend developer. there may be issues I'm not aware of, or that I'm aware of and I haven't been able to fix yet.

issues I'm aware of:
- TODO find issues

additionally, I don't maintain the [obsidian]() tooling that's used to edit and publish this site. if you find accessibility issues with obsidian itself, please forward those issues to the teamâ€”they're very easy to get in touch with. if you're unsure whether an issue is with my content or with obsidian's hosting, however, I'm happy to triage.
