## dev ❤️ ops

I've encountered many people who've heard of DevOps but don't really get what it's about, whether just entering tech or working in the industry for many years. Either it sounds overhyped, or they just don't understand the problems it's trying to solve. Terminology like this is always risky because predatory consultants and certificationists will co-opt the language and start charging you lots of money only to not give you devops at all. We saw this with the agile movement.

I was fortunate to be introduced to the DevOps movement early in my career thanks to *[The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/)*, a novel about an IT manager who has to deal with business demands on modern web services. Throughout listening to the audiobook of *The Phoenix Project* and its sequel *[The Unicorn Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-unicorn-project/)* (set concurrently), you'd frequently hear me yelling "Oh my God, fucking THANK YOU." You'd see me waving my hands and clenching my fists—very dangerous on a long driving commute. These allegories are based on the real experiences of many software teams, which is why they invoke such a visceral response. DevOps is about making things better for software teams, whether you specialize in infrastructure, algorithms, or UI.
