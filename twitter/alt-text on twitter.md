## notes

you should be writing meaningful alt-text for your images.

### where does alt-text show up?

the main accessibility use-case for alt-text is for people using screen readers, software that reads text out loud. blind people and people with vision impairment often navigate the web using screen readers, but other people who don't have vision impairment will also use screen readers for a number of reasons.

avoid making assumptions about your audience. the same person might rely on a screen reader for one task and video captions for a different task.

### how to add it on twitter

when you attach an image in the compose view in twitter, you'll see some small text near the bottom of the image that reads, "Add a description." click on that to open a composer for the image alt-text.
