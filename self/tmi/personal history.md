I grew up in the San Fernando Valley in an area that's technically a part of the city of Los Angeles, although many would deny that.
I didn't even realize that was the case until nearly adulthood.

Both my parents grew up in the Valley as well as all of their siblings.
In fact, the high school my parents attended?
I ended up going there as well.
