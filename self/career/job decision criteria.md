# job decision criteria
(as of August 2021)

## what motivates me?
- helping people do their jobs more easily and enjoy their work more
- seeing the impact of my work
- onboarding people and making the onboarding process better
- my biochemistry means that my brain is chronically low on dopamine. tiny bits of praise and acknowledgement go a looooong way

## what do I want in a role?
- I can't afford to burn out again
- work style
    - pairing, early feedback, continuous improvement, making work visible
    - no big announcements or launches
    - generally: I process information externally so if I'm working, you'll hear about it on Slack. we can figure out a good approach so I'm not just polluting team channels with my stream-of-consciousness messages
    - historically, I'm bad at asking for help and I often don't even realize I need help. I've figured out systems and strategies to get feedback early, which I'll continue adjusting and refining
- technical focus: I want the opportunity to learn a system and its quirks
    - I have some breadth, now I want depth
    - can be prod web services
    - can be a technology ecosystem
    - not just infra/k8s but I'm interested in deepening my knowledge there too
- schedule and workload flexibility
    - my brain has never been good at the 9-5 schedule. I prefer working in chunks throughout the day and I tend to focus better at night
    - I tend to be very engaged on Slack but let's discuss online hours vs. focus time
    - don't punish me for spending time on valuable work that happens to not be "top priority." reliability is a long game
    - embrace that I will embark on side quests in support of the main quest
