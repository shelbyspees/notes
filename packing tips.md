I'm moving right now (August 2021).

these are some things that will hopefully make this move a lot smoother than past moves.

**no-tape moving boxes with holes for your hands.**
I got the banker's box premium moving boxes with the flap-lock lid thing that goes in the holes.
super pricy but they make packing way more pleasant because they significantly reduce the number of steps involved in setting up a new box.
you also get way less noise.
seriously, packing tape is the worst.

**foam cushion bag things for fragile items.**
slip it in the bag and it stays put.
way easier than wrapping things in foam sheets/bubble wrap and then securing it with tape or stretch wrap.
bonus: the set came with "fragile" stickers for labeling boxes.

**pre-printed room label stickers** for labeling boxes.
it took me a while to find the ones for individual rooms instead of the sets, but they're way more legible than hand-writing on a box (plus I'm way less likely to get smelly ink all over my hands).
I got these with rewards points so I'm treating them as a "sparks joy" bonus nice-to-have.

**labeled ziplock bags** for screws, cables, and other small parts.
this is the first time I've thought to label each bag as I disassemble things.
no clue what took me so long.
for the labels, I'm just using painter's tape and a sharpie.

**actual movers!**
I've rarely had several hundred bucks to throw at movers before with all the other expenses of moving, but this time it's worth it.
I love that they have their own truck so that I don't have to bother with renting a U-Haul.
